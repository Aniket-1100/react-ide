# ⚛️ React Component IDE

**React Component IDE** is a sleek, fast, and developer-friendly playground built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**. It allows users to write JSX and CSS with live preview functionality, making it ideal for prototyping, learning, and experimenting with React components in real-time. The editor features syntax highlighting, auto-save, fullscreen mode, responsive preview options, and one-click export capabilities—all wrapped in a clean, modern UI. Built with care by **Aniket Pratap Singh**, this open-source project is free to use under the MIT License and can be hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting service.
